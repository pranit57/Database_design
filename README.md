The world of coding fascinated me when I joined the IT Industry and I have been working as a software developer for more than 3.5 years. 
I am presently working at NICE as a Software Engineer.  
I enjoy the process of problem-solving and appreciate algorithms, which are helpful in solving them and build new ideas. 

Previously, I worked on a Blockchain-based project at Infosys Ltd. 
I was responsilbe for the design and development and the different modules of the application, writing clean code, reviewing code, doing project planning, and finalizing the design.

I am a believer in upskilling myself and pushing to be more adaptable to ever-changing technology and methods.
It's always fascinating to be part of the development team and accelerating the process of producing simpler, efficient, and well-tested code.
I've learned several new technologies as a result of my enthusiasm for product design, and this journey is still ongoing.
